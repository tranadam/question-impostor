        Everyone discretely draws a question and writes down their answer. The catch is, some of the
        players unknowingly receive an impostor question. Once everyone locks their answer, original
        question is revealed along with all answers. Players discuss who they think the impostor is,
        then vote. If the majority correctly identifies the impostor, they win. If not, the impostor
        wins!
